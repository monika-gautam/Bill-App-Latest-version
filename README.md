# Bill-App-Latest-version
This latest version contains some improvements along with resolving previous issues like number format bug for bill amount & garbled entries in PDF generated for monthly expenses. New features like reviewing/editing added entries before bill generation, viewing history of claimed expenses for a particular date etc have been incorporated & this app also prohibits the users now to add duplicate entries for a certain date mistakenly, thus provides consistency during bill generation.
